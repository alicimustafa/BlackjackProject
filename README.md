#### Overview
this project is a command-line blackjack game.

#### Topics Covered
* Inheritance and Interface 
* Collection List Set and Map
* Unit testing with JUnit

#### How to play
Game follows basic Casino rules
with one dealor and up to 6 players
currently the shoe hold 4 decks. 

#### future updates 
I plan on implementing full Casino rules like double downs, splits and insurance.
Currently the shoe size is hard coded to 4. I would like to update that so shoe size
can be chosen by the user.  I would like to implementing a monetary system.
